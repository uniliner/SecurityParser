-----
v fix bug when commit has 0 changes
v easy way to run analysis on PR
v add PR body to data, insist that the llm not take it 100%
- read current prompts and consider changes
- false positive - false negative detection 
- better var naming and add comments
- add short reasoning behind category selection for the llm response
- check if PR commits can be squashed before sending to the llm to reduce noise

Future improvements
--------------------
- update pr-analysis-prompt-final.md //TODO sections
- find a way to send system prompts and main prompt once in the conversation and only send PR data each time
  is it possible ? what do we need to make it happen ?
- improve system prompts
- explore langchain chains usage
- currently only file changes are checked. need to add handling of newly added files and file deletions
- decide whether to include pom.xml changes in the analysis
